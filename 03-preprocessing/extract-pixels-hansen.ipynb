    "One-hot encoding is typically used for categorical variables, where there is no inherent ordering or numerical relationship between the categories. In your case, the year of deforestation does have an inherent ordering (i.e., 2007 comes before 2008) and possibly a numerical relationship (i.e., deforestation in earlier years might influence deforestation in later years), so treating it as a categorical variable might not be the best approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a nuance in your case. If a pixel gets deforested in a particular year, it remains deforested in all subsequent years. This means that a pixel deforested in 2007 will also be deforested in 2008, 2009, and so on. If you use the year of deforestation as a numeric value, you might be inadvertently suggesting that deforestation in 2008 is \"more\" or \"greater\" than deforestation in 2007, which is not necessarily the case. Instead, you're just tracking the first year of deforestation for each pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this, you might consider the following approach:\n",

    "Binary Encoding: For each year, create a binary raster indicating whether deforestation occurred in that year or not. This would give you a series of rasters with values of [0, 1] for each year.\n",

    "This approach allows the model to learn from the temporal sequence of deforestation events without misinterpreting the year of deforestation as a numerical value. However, it does not explicitly encode the information that once a pixel is deforested, it remains deforested in all subsequent years. You will need to ensure that your model architecture can capture this temporal dependency.\n",

    "Lagged features are created by shifting the original feature values along the time dimension. They represent the values of a feature at an earlier time step. In the context of your deforestation problem, a lagged feature would represent whether deforestation occurred in a pixel in the previous year(s). By including these lagged features in your model, you allow the model to learn how deforestation in earlier years affects deforestation in later years.\n",

    "Here's a step-by-step example of creating lagged features for your deforestation data:\n",

For example, the 2002 raster would be shifted to 2001, the 2003 raster to 2002, and so on. The last raster (2011) would need to be filled with zeros or dropped, as there is no data available for 2012.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now have 11 rasters, where each raster represents whether deforestation occurred in the previous year (1) or not (0). These are the lagged features with a lag of 1 year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack these new lagged rasters together with the original rasters. This would create a 3D array (height x width x 2 * time), where each layer in the third dimension corresponds to a year and its corresponding lagged year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this new 3D array as input to your Random Forest model. The model will now learn the relationship between deforestation in the previous year(s) and the current year, which may help it better capture temporal dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, I used a lag of 1 year, but you can experiment with different lag values depending on your data and problem. For instance, you could create lagged features for 2 or 3 years to capture longer-term dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is just one way to introduce temporal information into a non-temporal model like Random Forest. There might be other ways to incorporate temporal information, and it's worth experimenting to find the best approach for your data and problem."
